# Multilingual-File_Manager

The Multi-User File Manager Application simulates a real-world scenario, such as a collaborative project workspace. This application allows multiple users to manage their files effectively while ensuring secure access and a user-friendly interface.

### Key Features

- **User Management**: 
  - Secure user registration and login with password hashing.
  
- **File Management**: 
  - Users can create, read, update, and delete files within their designated directories.
  
- **Multilingual Support (i18n)**: 
  - Users can select their preferred language for the user interface.
  
- **Queuing System**: 
  - Utilize Redis to queue asynchronous tasks like file uploads (optional: include progress tracking).
  
- **Unit Testing**: 
  - Write unit tests for core functionalities, including user authentication, file management, and the queuing system.

### Optional Features

- Implement file versioning.
- Add a search functionality.
- Integrate with a cloud storage service.

## Technical Considerations

- **Databases**: 
  - Choose either MySQL or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) to store user data, file metadata, and directory structures.
  
- **Queuing System**: 
  - Use Redis and a queuing library to manage asynchronous tasks.
  
- **Node.js Framework**: 
  - Utilize Express.js to structure your application.
  
- **Authentication**: 
  - Implement secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt) and consider using Passport.js for authentication.
  
- **i18n Libraries**: 
  - Choose an i18n library (e.g., i18next) for internationalization.
  
- **Testing Framework**: 
  - Use Jest or Mocha for unit testing.
